#Pipeline to call SNPs from Oculina TagSeq data:
#Author: Hannah Aichelman, adapted from Sarah Barfield
#Last Updated: June 12, 2020 to map to new reference
#This pipeline takes TagSeq data and calls SNPs with the purpose of figuring out clones in the dataset

#Originally was having an issue with the way I mapped for TagSeq vs. what the sam to bam needs
#Seems to be an issue with headers.
#So trying to map the way Nicola did (https://github.com/Nicfall/moorea_holobiont/blob/master/mr_2brad/part2_filt_map_walkthrough.txt), testing with one sample first:

module load bowtie2
[haich@scc-yd4 snps]$ bowtie2 --no-unal --score-min L,16,1 --local -L 16 -x /projectnb/davies-hb/hannah/MPCC_2018/Oculina/ref/Oculina_Breviolum_combined_transcriptome.fasta -U Oculina_OA4_S45_R1_001.fastq.trim -S Oculina_OA4_S45_R1_001.trim.test.sam
81024 reads; of these:
  81024 (100.00%) were unpaired; of these:
    54870 (67.72%) aligned 0 times
    5547 (6.85%) aligned exactly 1 time
    20607 (25.43%) aligned >1 times
32.28% overall alignment rate


#Seems to have fixed the problem, when I re-run the sam to bam conversion on this test mapping it works!
#Now re-map all .trim files
#Download 2bRAD_bowtie2_launch.pl from Misha's github: https://github.com/z0on/2bRAD_denovo/blob/master/2bRAD_bowtie2_launch.pl

module load bowtie2


#this is mapping to the newest reference transcriptome 6/15/2020
#example line in script:
bowtie2 --no-unal --score-min L,16,1 --local -L 16 -x /projectnb/davies-hb/hannah/MPCC_2018/Oculina/ref/Oculina_Brev_transcriptome_new.fasta -U Oculina_OA6_S20_R1_001.fastq.trim -S Oculina_OA6_S20_R1_001.fastq.trim.bt2.sam

#breakdown =
#--no-unal = suppress SAM records for unaligned reads
#--score-min L,16,1 [L = linear --> f(x) = 16 + 1 * x]
#--local -L 16 = Sets the length of the seed substrings to align during multiseed alignment. 
#Smaller values make alignment slower but more sensitive


#this is different from the tagseq mapping script in a few ways. the tagseq method includes these unique flags:
--no-hd = suppress SAM header lines (starting with @)
--no-sq  = suppress @SQ SAM header lines
-k = indicates -k mode. In this mode, bowtie searches for up to N distinct, valid alignments for each read. We have -k 5, meaning bowtie will search for at most 5 distinct alignments. 
The manual says that the -k mode is effective in situations where you care more about whether a read aligns, or aligns a certain number of times, rather than where exactly it originated


#need to parse the sam files into host and sym specific files. Matt Kanke wrote this to help:

for x in *bt2.sam; do echo $x; grep 'Oarb\|SO:unsorted' $x &> ${x//sam/Oarb.sam}; grep 'Sym\|SO:unsorted' $x &> ${x//sam/Sym.sam}; done

#create file 'sams' that is a list of all sam files

# -minMapQ 20 : only highly unique mappings (prob of erroneous mapping = 1%)\
# -baq 1 : realign around indels (not terribly relevant for 2bRAD reads mapped with --local option) \
# -maxDepth : highest total depth (sum over all samples) to assess; set to 10x number of samples \

# in the angsd command, -r argument is one chromosome or contig to work with (no need to do this for whole genome as long as the chosen chromosome or contig is long enough)
# (look up lengths of your contigs in the header of *.sam files if you need)
# bams is a file with a list of your bam files

#Looks really weird, but not sure what to expect for just one contig. Going to move forward with genotyping with strict filters below.

##note, didn't do this for the new reference mapping yet##


#### genotype with ANGSD #### 

#--------------- population structure (based on common polymorphisms)

# F I L T E R S :
# (ALWAYS record your filter settings and explore different combinations to confirm that results are robust. )
# Suggested filters :
# -minMapQ 20 : only highly unique mappings (prob of erroneous mapping = 1%)
# -minQ 30 : only highly confident base calls
#could make this 20 to get more snps

# -minInd 36 : the site must be genotyped in at least 36 individuals (note: set this to ~ 80% of your total number of your individuals)
#lower this if you want more snps
#set to 22 for the _noclones analysis
#set to 14 for the _noclones2 analysis

# -minIndDepth 6 : depth of at least 6 in non-missing individual
#change to 5 to get more snps, no lower than 5 though
#made 10 for the noclones2 analysis to make extra sure with so few samples

# -snp_pval 1e-3 : high confidence that the SNP is not just sequencing error 
# -minMaf 0.05 : only common SNPs, with allele frequency 0.05 or more.
# Note: the last two filters are very efficient against sequencing errors but introduce bias against true rare alleles. It is OK (and even desirable) - UNLESS we want to do AFS analysis. We will generate data for AFS analysis in the next part.\
# also adding  filters against very badly non-HWE sites (such as, all calls are heterozygotes => lumped paralog situation) and sites with really bad strand bias:\


# T O   D O : \
# -GL 1 : samtools likelihood model\
# -doGlf 2 : output beagle format (for admixture)\
# -doGeno 32 : binary genotype likelihoods format (for ngsCovar => PCA)\
# -doMajorMinor 4 -ref $GENOME_REF : infer major and minor alleles from reference (in our case it is outgroup taxon)\
# -makeMatrix 1 -doIBS 1 -doCov 1 : identity-by-state and covariance matrices based on single-read resampling (robust to variation in coverage across samples)\
# TO-DO commands can be changed to generate different files needed for different analyses as well (http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/ANGSD#Overview) 

#skipTrialellic 1 #could add this if you want to remove triallelic snps, usually a sequencing error

#Request an interactive node before you start this analysis, might get kicked off for taking up too much memory on the head node
qrsh -pe omp 12

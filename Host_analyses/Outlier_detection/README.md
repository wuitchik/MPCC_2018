## Here, we identify outliers using various approaches for both Astrangia poculata and Oculina arbuscula.

### SNP relatedness on dendrogram
In this analysis, the dendrogram for A. poculata (Astrangiahas the sample AP4 displaying disimilar clustering with all other samples. For this reason it was removed from subsequent analysis. Furthermore, while not outliers, it was identified that there was unintentional clonality in Oculina arbuscula. We renamed the genotypes to reflect this, and took a random sample from each clone in each treatment group to avoid unitentional pseudoreplication. The remaining clonal samples were not used in subsequent analyses.

Clonal samples with new genotype identifiers (see Oculina_dendrogram.pdf)

- Z = genotype N+O+P
- Y = genotype L+M
- X = genotype H+K

### using arrayQualityMetrics
Two samples (AF2,AS3) were identified as outliers in A. poculata (see Astrangia/index.html)

### unlikely clustering in ordinal space
When initially exploring data with a principal component analysis (see AC1_PCA.png), one A. poculata sample (AC1) was identified as an outlier due to its extreme position relative to other samples of the same treatment in ordinal space.
